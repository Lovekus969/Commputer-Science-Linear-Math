System of equations

A system is just multiple linear equations working together. Example:

2x+y=5


2. Matrix Form

We can represent the system using matrices and vectors:

𝐴𝑥 = 𝑏
                                      Ax=b
3. Vector View

The system means that a linear combination of column vectors of
