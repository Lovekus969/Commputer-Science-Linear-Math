What is Linear Algebra?

Linear Algebra is a branch of math that deals with linear equations, vectors, and matrices.
Homogeneous System of Linear Equations

A homogeneous system is when all constant terms (the right-hand side of the equations) are zero.
Definition

A set of vectors (or functions, or equations) is said to be linearly independent if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others.

Otherwise, they are linearly dependent.
